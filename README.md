# Calculator with AI Integration

This project is a web-based calculator with an interactive feature that allows users to draw mathematical equations or problems on a canvas. The drawn content is captured and sent to the backend for analysis. The backend processes the drawing, interprets the math expressions, and returns the solution using Google's Gemini AI model.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Drawing**: Use the canvas to draw mathematical equations or graphical problems.
- **AI-Powered Math Analysis**: The backend uses Google's Gemini AI to interpret and solve the drawn content.
- **Real-Time Results**: Get instant results and solutions from the AI.
- **Responsive Interface**: A user-friendly interface designed for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: A fast development and build tool.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application with a modern, utility-first approach.
- **Shadcn & Mantine**: For additional UI components and design.
- **React Router DOM**: For routing and navigation.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the server-side logic.
- **Express**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests.
- **Google Gemini AI**: The backend uses the Gemini API to solve mathematical problems from the user input.
- **Sharp**: For image processing of the drawn content.
